# language-asp package

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for classic ASP files into Atom.

I have only converted this from the TextMate bundle, and have made no other changes if you feel anything is missing or is needed please feel free to fork and drop me a merge request.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
